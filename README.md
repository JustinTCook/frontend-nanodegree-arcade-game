# Arcade Game Clone - Udacity Course Project

## Purpose
Built as part of the Front End Web Development Udacity nanodegree. Used as an exercise in advanced JavaScript with a focus on Object Oriented Programming.

## How to play
Clone or download the repo and open the index.html file.

Move the character using the arrow keys to avoid hitting bugs as you attempt to make it to the water. Upon making it to the water or colliding with a bug, the character will move back to their starting position so you can try again.
